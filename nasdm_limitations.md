\subsubsection{Evaluation based on patches}
In this study, we emphasize that the expert evaluation presented is performed within a very controlled and specific setting, where evaluators are tasked with analyzing $128 \times 128$ pixel patches of Whole Slide Images (WSI). This approach significantly deviates from the typical method that pathologists use when interpreting histological tissues, which involves examining much larger regions of tissue at varying levels of magnification. The constrained focus on small image patches might limit the evaluators' ability to capture the broader context of tissue architecture and the relationships between different cellular structures, which could influence diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, the evaluation, as presented, should be interpreted within the confines of this artificial setup, and caution must be exercised when extending these results to more conventional histological evaluation scenarios.

\subsubsection{Scope of the evaluation}
Moreover, the evaluation criteria were restricted to the four dimensions explicitly mentioned in the previous sections. Although these metrics are important for assessing certain aspects of model performance, they do not encompass the full complexity of histopathological diagnosis, which includes nuanced morphological patterns and clinical context. As a result, this limited scope may not fully capture the model's ability to generalize beyond these criteria, nor does it account for all possible ways in which the generated patches might be useful or flawed in broader medical practice. We recognize that there may be medically relevant patterns, particularly those that pathologists rely on for nuanced diagnostic decisions, which the model does not replicate with high fidelity. These patterns may escape detection in the qualitative assessments made by our small panel of experts, especially given the relatively narrow set of criteria under consideration.

\subsubsection{Size of the expert panel}
It is also important to note that our panel consists of only two pathologists, which may introduce an element of subjectivity in the evaluation. While these experts bring considerable experience to their assessments, the small sample size of evaluators means that the results should be interpreted with caution. Different experts might have slightly different interpretations or levels of comfort in assessing the synthesized patches, which could potentially lead to variation in the evaluation outcomes if the panel were larger or more diverse. Therefore, any conclusions drawn from this evaluation need to be tempered with an understanding of this limitation.

\subsubsection{Generalization to other tissue types}
Furthermore, the model was specifically demonstrated on a dataset of colon tissue samples, and it remains uncertain whether the modelâ€™s performance will hold when applied to other types of tissue or disease contexts. Histological structures and disease manifestations can vary widely between tissue types, and thus, the model's ability to generalize beyond the colon dataset should not be assumed. Future research should aim to extend the evaluation to include other datasets, encompassing a broader range of tissue types and pathologies, to better understand the generalizability and robustness of the model in diverse clinical scenarios.
